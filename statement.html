  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p><em>Who are you and what do you care about as an artist? What kind of subjects do you explore in your work?</em></p>
    <p><strong>On the surface</strong>, I am a full-time student that is currently trying to get a BFA in Graphic Design. I like dogs, and long walks on the beach. And pina coladas and getting caught in the rain. 
      But as an artist, I desire my work to reflect the inner desires, feelings, and depths of human emotion but portayed in abstract forms. I have also dabbled in the media of film, animation, and media art.</p>
    <p><em>How does the approaches you take in your work reflect your interests? What do you do to explore the ideas previously said?</em></p>
  <p>I try to show these ideas pieces of myself in hopes that people who see it can relive that same experience.
